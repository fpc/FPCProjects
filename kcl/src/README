Note: In the following, the term "target" refers to the different
      implementations for different platforms and/or toolkits.


Subdirectory "inc"
------------------
This directory contains the common include files for the "interface" sections
of all KCL targets.
h_master.inc is the main include file, it $INCLUDEs several "h*.inc" files.

Subdirectory "common"
---------------------
This directory contains all code which can be shared between different KCL
targets. h_master.inc should be included in the implementation parts of all
KCL units, it provides some common method and function implementations.
This file $INCLUDEs most of the other "c*.inc" files.

Subdirectory "kcl_gtk"
----------------------
GTK+ (version >= 1.2) target implementation

Subdirectory "kcl_w32"
----------------------
Win32 target implementation


The first character of all .inc files determines its kind:
h*.inc => header (interface)
c*.inc => common implementation
g*.inc => GTK
w*.inc => Win32



Compiler switches and symbols
=============================

Event debugging
---------------
Define the symbol "DebugEvents" (compiler command line switch: "-dDebugEvents")
while compiling to get a dump of all events occuring in the system.
