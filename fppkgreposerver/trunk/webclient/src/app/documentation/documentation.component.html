      # What is this website for?

      This website maintains a collection of Free Pascal packges. The packages are in the FPMake
      format.

      ## How can I use these packages?

      To easiest way to install a package is by using `fppkg`, a tool which is part of the Free Pascal
      distribution. Type the following on a command-line to download and install a package:

      `fppkg install &lt;package name&gt;`

      Once installed all the units within the package are ready to be used in your code.

      ## Why do I have to select the version of the Free Pascal compiler (FPC)?

      Not all packages are available for every FPC-version, or the version of the package that
      is available may differ.

      ## I have never used `fppkg` before, but a lot of packages are already installed, how is this possible?

      A lot of the packages within this repository are also bundled with Free pascal and are installed
      by default. This repository is used to dictribute updates of those packages.

      ## What are the 'fixes' and 'trunk' FPC-versions?

      These are the development versions of Free Pascal, which can change any minute. At this moment
      fixes correspond to the version-number 3.2.1 and trunk to 3.3.1. Normally you do not need those.

      ## What are there much less packages available for the FPC-versions 'fixes' and 'trunk'?

      The packages within this repository which are also part of Free Pascal itself are missing
      for these development FPC-versions. This because these fpc-versions are moving targets
      that can change any minute. So distributing updates makes no sense.

      ## Where do these packages come from?

      Anyone can add their own Pascal-packages to this repository.

      ## What does 'support' stands for?

      The packages marked with 'Free Pascal development team' are distributed and maintained
      by the Free Pascal team. 'Community' packages are added by others.

      # How can I add my own packages?

      Adding packages is not difficult. It comes with a responsibility though, users will expect
      you to maintain the packages, and provide updates when they are made available.

      To add a package, follow these steps:

      1. Create a FPMake-based package for your project by adding a fpmake.pp file.
      2. Create an archive for your package. This can by done by running `fppkg archive`.
      3. Login to this website, using your account for the Free Pascal bugtracker or
         Forum.
      4. Test-build your package. Go to the 'build' section of this website, choose one of
         the buildagents, upload your package and choose 'Build package'. Please fix any
         issued before adding the package.
      5. Add the package using the 'add package' button at the bottom of the list with
         packages. Enter the name of the package. Make sure that the name matches the name
         in the fpmake.pp file exactly. (case-sensitive)
      6. Search the new package in the list and click on it. Make sure to select the FPC-version
         you want to upload the package for, and choose 'Upload source' and upload the
         package-archive.
      7. The just uploaded version is now available in the 'Upload history' list. You may have
         to click on it so it expands. Now do another test-build.
      8. Once you are satisfied with the uploaded source, 'tag' the package. By tagging the
         upload, you mark the upload as a specific version. Once an upload has been tagged into
         a version, it is only possible to upload archives with an higher version.
      9. New packages have to be approved by an administrator, before they are added to
         a repository. So you have to wait until your package gets approved.
      10. Once approved, when you select the new version of the package, a 'publish to testing'
         buttons appears. Press this button to add the package to the testing repository. Your
         package is not available immediately. Rebuilding the repository is a manual steps
         which has to be done by an administrator.

      ## What is the difference between the testing and production repositories?

      Only administators can add packages to the production repositories. The testing repositories
      are there so that people can add their own packages and updates to those packages, without
      the interferral of an administrator. This way it is possible to test your own or someone
      else's packages.

      ## How can I install the packages from the testing-repository?

      You have to adapt your `fppkg` configuration. Locate the fppkg.cfg configuration file.
      (one way to do this is to run `fppkg -v` and scan the output)  Then change the
      'remotemirrors' to 'http://fppkg.cnoc.nl/repo/testing/mirrors.xml'
