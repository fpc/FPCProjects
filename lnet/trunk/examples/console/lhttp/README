fphttpd is a full-featured HTTP 1.1 server.

Fast-CGI support enables use of php and other pre-processors.

fphttpd creates default config files and directories on first run in:
For windows: HOMEDRIVE:\HOMEPATH\fphttpd (usualy Documents and settings\username)
For unix: $HOME/.fphttpd

The directory consists of:
cgi-bin -- place your cgi scripts and binaries here
http_docs -- place your html files here
fphttpd.ini -- configure file with various settings
mime.types -- mime types file for various file types

Currently, fphttpd doesn't support fastCGI in windows. This is being worked on.

In unix, external "CGI apps" like php need to be "fastcgi-spawned" for the server.

You do this with the spawn-fcgi program.
