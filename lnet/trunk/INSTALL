For visual package (lnetpackage dir) you need to use Lazarus. See lnetpackage/README and lnetpackage/INSTALL.

For LNET, LTCP, LUDP and LFTPl you need to do is type "make". (imake can make it too)
Make.exe is shipped in win32 along with Free Pascal.
Possible options are:

make -- compiles all examples and lib with -XX -Xs -O2
make debug -- compiles lib with debug info in(bounds check etc. as well)
make memcheck -- compiles lib with memory checks in 
make clean -- deletes the object files and ppus(requires delp, part of FPC)

Usage: if you want to use lnet in your project, just copy the lNet directory somewhere and put it in compiler's unit search path with -Fu.

Units:

lnet.pas - this is the main workmule of the whole library. Contains all base classes and helper functions
levents.pas - this is the "eventer" unit which holds TLEventer classes.
ltelnet.pas - this is the telnet protocol addition. Currently only the client works.
lftp.pas - this is the FTP protocol addition. Currently only the client works.

Layout:

lnet/ -- this root dir
lnet/lib -- the library dir for all lnet libraries
lnet/lib/sys -- system specific units and include files for lnet libraries
lnet/examples -- console and visual example programs
lnet/lazaruspackage -- visual package for lazarus
