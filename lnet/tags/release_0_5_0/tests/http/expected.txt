0.4.0 is here! Get it in the downloads section.<br>
This page will get reworked. In the meantime the main information site should be:<br>
<a href="http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/lNet">http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/lNet</a><br><br>
The packages are now "combined" into one zip. You get both visual and console lnet in one package this way.<br>
See README and INSTALL files for more info.

Since last release of 0.3.1 we have been working hard on the 0.4.x branch which adds alot of new features and is a complete internal redesign of lNet.<br><br>

We are currently trying the clean the 0.4.0 lNet of bugs so that the release is trouble-less for all platforms.<br><br>

Changes include new internal structure (NO API changes, except one property in TLSocket for consistency, will be documented) with "eventer" classes which take care of events. This enables us to use native best-perfomance solutions on various platforms (epoll in linux, kqueue in BSDs, io ports in windows and so on). It also enables users to "watch" for events on normal files and objects(in case of windows) so they save alot of processing power (just one or few syscalls in place for tens).<br><br>

The http server has been updated and experimental fastcgi support is currently being added.
There's also a http client with a "Get" example program.<br><br>

SMTP was added to 0.4.0 including a visual version for lNet.<br><br>

We hope to release 0.4.0 in one week (25th of September 2006).
