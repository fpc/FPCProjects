fphttpd is a full-featured HTTP 1.1 server.

Fast-CGI support enables use of php and other pre-processors.

fphttpd creates default config files and directories on first run in:
For windows: HOMEDRIVE:\HOMEPATH\fphttpd (usualy Documents and settings\username)
For unix: $HOME/.fphttpd

The directory consists of:
cgi-bin -- place your cgi scripts and binaries here
http_docs -- place your html files here
fphttpd.ini -- configure file with various settings
mime.types -- mime types file for various file types

fphttpd tries to automaticly spawn php using the fpfcgi spawner program.

You can pre-spawn your fCGI apps to get some initial boost.

On Windows it is REQUIRED to edit fphttpd.ini and set path to "php-cgi.exe" as this one has not got a default install location (in unix it's searched in some default dirs like /usr/bin and so on)

WARNING:
Currently fastcgi only works in linux and has some known issues. Use only for testing purposes
