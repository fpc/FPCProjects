For LNET, LTCP, LUDP and LFTPl you need to do is type "make". (imake can make it too)
Make.exe is shipped in win32 along with Free Pascal.
Possible options are:

make debug -- compiles with debug info in(bounds check etc. as well)
make memcheck -- compiles with memory checks in 
make clean -- deletes the object files and ppus(requires delp, part of FPC)

Usage: if you want to use lnet in your project, just copy the lNet directory somewhere and put it in compiler's unit search path with -Fu.

Units:

lnet.pas - this is the main workmule of the whole library. Contains all base classes and helper functions

ltelnet.pas - this is the telnet protocol addition. Currently only the client works.

lftp.pas - this is the FTP protocol addition. Currently only the client works.
