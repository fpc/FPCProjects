Make sure you enter your DB password (MASTERKEY) in the cgifpcbot.pas file before compilation.
After you compile everything put the cgi/cgifpcbot file into your cgi directory.
Use the file "create_database_script.sql"(view it for instructions, again, change the password to your db one) to create the FB database.
When everything's done just run lfpcbot. It will automagicly connect to FreeNode.
Issue commands by /msg <command> or FPCBot <command>. If you want to change the server
or default channels/power user list, edit the sources(will be changed later to a config file).
