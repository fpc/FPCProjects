REQUIREMENTS:

FPC 2.0.1 or 2.1.1.
Firebird2 - classic or superserver.
Apache or other web server capable of CGI-BIN.
Permissions for your database.

------------------------------------------AUTO INSTALL---------------------------------------------

BEFORE COMPILATION:

Make sure the directory to which the database file will be place(you'll get asked during install)
is owned by "firebird" group and user. Otherwise the DB cannot be created.

COMPILATION AND INSTALL:

make auto
make install (as root)

-----------------------------------MANUAL INSTALL GUIDE--------------------------------------------


BEFORE COMPILATION:
Make sure to modify the include/hiddeninc.inc.default file so it has your paths and passwords.
Then rename the file to include/hiddeninc.inc
Modify cgi/create_database_script.sql and change all "masterkey" to your sysdba password.
In same file (in the upper comment) change the fpcbot password and cgifpc password to those in hiddeninc.inc.
Then run the gsec command as is specified in the (now modified) create_database.sql file.
Lastly run the cgi/create_database_script.sql as is specified inside to create your new log/defines database.

SPECIAL NOTE: The isql binary varies from system to system. Sometimes it's isql-fb and so on. Look in your firebird/bin directory to see what the binary name is.

COMPILATION:

make

AFTER COMPILATION:

After you compile everything put the cgi/cgifpcbot file and cgi/html directory into your cgi directory.

Put the newly created DB into the desired directory. In unix make sure the file is writable by group "firebird" and that you as user are a part of this group. In windows, let me know how this works.
Edit bot/botconfig.cfg.default and change $root and $channel to default user and channel.
Save as bot/botconfig.cfg

When everything's done just run lfpcbot. It will automagicly connect to FreeNode.
Issue commands by /msg <command> or BotName <command>.
