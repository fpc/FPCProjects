Oxygene v1.1
=======

-=+ Legal Bits & Others +=---------------------------------------------

This game is released as FREEWARE and I except no responsibility for
any damage caused by using this programme. You can distribute it
freely and please send a copy to your friends. All I ask is for you to
send me an e-mail with your opinion about this game, ideas,
bug-reports or anything you want. Write me if you can draw nice
graphics because I can't draw nice sprites, tiles, backgrounds, etc.


-=+ Description +=-----------------------------------------------------

With your character named Clyde you must collect all the diamonds in
all of the undersea caverns. Avoid almost everything what moves. The
small fishes don't hurt you and the small bubbles increase your oxygene
level. The rocks are useful but can be dangerous too.


-=+ Controls +=--------------------------------------------------------

* Title screen:  ESC - exit game
                 SPACE - start game
* in game: ESC - return to title
           CURSORS - move your hero
           P - pause
* "Do You Wanna Quit?" bubble: Y or ENTER - yes
                               N or ESC - no.
Remark: if you use hungarian keyboard where the Y and Z keys are
swapped hit Z instead of Y or use ENTER. Sorry for this, maybe it will
fixed in a later version.


-=+ System Requirements +=---------------------------------------------

Minimal System Requirements:  
 * Pentium-166, 
 * Windows 95/98/ME/2000/Linux (The OS you compiled)
 * DirectX 6.0, 
 * DirectX compatible video (must support 640x480) and sound system.


-=+ If a problem occured... +=-----------------------------------------

- The default video mode is fullscreen. The program automatically
  detects the color depth in this order:

   * The game attempt to start with the desktop's color depth
   * 15 bpp (32k colors) parameter: "15bpp"
   * 16 bpp (64k colors) parameter: "16bpp"
   * 24 bpp (16m colors) parameter: "24bpp"
   * 32 bpp (16m colors) parameter: "32bpp"
   * 8  bpp (256 colors) parameter: "8bpp"

  P.e. "Oxygene.exe 32bpp" will start the game with 16m colors (and if
  not available then emulate it (SLOW!).

  If the game starts with ugly and noisy colours when windowed then
  check your desktop's color depth is greater than 256 colours.

  The 8 bit colour depth will improve performance but some visual
  effect will disappear.

- You can change the fullscreen mode to windowed with this parameter:
  "windowed".

  P.e. "Oxygene.exe windowed"

- You can turn off the sound and music with this parameter:
  "nosound".

  P.e. "Oxygene.exe nosound"

- If you have an older soundcard you can use these parameters:
  "22khz" for 22KHz mixing frequency (default is 44KHz),
  "11khz" for 11Khz mixing frequency,
  "mono" for mono mixing (default is stereo).
  "8bit" for 8 bit sound cards (default is 16 bit).

These parameters can be combined.
P.e. "Oxygene nosound 8bpp" will start the game in 256 color mode,
fullscreen and without sounds and music.

- Here are listed all the parameters:
  * 8bpp
  * 15bpp
  * 16bpp
  * 24bpp
  * 32bpp
  * windowed
  * 11khz
  * 22khz
  * 8bit
  * mono
  * nosound
