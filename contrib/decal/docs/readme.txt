Notes about DeCAL
-----------------

This directory currently contains a preliminary release of the DeCAL library.  
DeCAL descends from (and replaces) the SDL library, formerly a commercial
product from Soletta.  DeCAL provides a solid theoretical base for data
structures and sophisticated applications written in Delphi.

Even though this is a preliminary release, it is only preliminary in the 
sense that refinements for open source have yet to be completed.  DeCAL/SDL
is part of many commercial Delphi applications.

The documentation in this directory (DeCAL Guide.pdf) is the documentation
for SDL.  Just replace each instance of "SDL" with DeCAL, and you'll be all
set.  The documentation will be updated to reflect the new name soon. 

I hope you enjoy using DeCAL.
