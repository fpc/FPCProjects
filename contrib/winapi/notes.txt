CVS Import changes
- dos2unix (CVS is unix)
- renamed *.pas to *.pp
- strip {$externalsym <blaat>} ( next import should kill HPPEMITs too)

Makefiles
winapi now has makefiles, but is still a bit problematic. (some files
don't build, and there is some cyclic problem going on)

Batchfiles: (convtools dir))
- comp.bat compiles each file. If error level<>0 the compile output is appended
               to longlog.log. Uses docomp.bat to do the actual compiling
- finddep.bat is used to generate the dependancy information in
    makefile.fpc. See filtervt.pas source for more details
    also calls docomp2.bat


jwawintype
- fixed pulong_ptr=pulong_ptr. Is this a bug in winapi or FPC?
- fixed wchar(0) problem
