==Compiling with Heaptrc==
When developing fpprofiler it can be usefull to compile it with heaptrc
the fpmake.pp file in the root directory contains a define HEAPTRC which 
should be enabled. All included files will see this define and compile their
targets with heaptrc support.
To direct the output to a file set an environment variable 
HEAPTRC='log=heaptrc.log'.
