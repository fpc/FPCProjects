This directory contains the source code of the FPC/32 Bit Dos conversion of
TechnoJock's Turbo Toolkit 5.10. The buildttt.exe program at the end of the
build process can be deleted safely.

To make it clear: this conversion *only* works for the Go32v2 Dos target,
not for anything else (no Windows, no Linux, no nothing)
