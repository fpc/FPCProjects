Decal compiled under FPC 1,1 after a few bugfixes to FPC. (1.1 from oct 8,
2003 or later)

Changes to decal made while importing were very minor:
- the D6 compability fix, USE'ing the variants unit in the body of the 
   decal unit
- Adding {$IFDEF FPC} {$DEFINE DELPHI5} somewhere.

More fixes will be done as time goes by, which can be logged below (or
use the CVS logs)

All fixes accepted for this directory are placed under LGPL/MPL dual license
