ICS



Used FPC compiler: 1.1.x development series 26 august or later.
                (this includes 2.0 beta's)

Changes:

The ICS package central vc32 dir has 4 types of units:

1 units that compile right away with 1.1 with only the "general"
        changes and maybe a few very small detail fixes (see "per file"
        and can be tested using one of the con<x> files.
2 same 1, but can't be tested because there is no console demo.
3 units that use forms, but only for (de)allocatehwnd and/or the
    application object. (see "dummy forms" paragraph)
    (tncnx, pop3prot, nntpcli and ftpsrv )
4 Heavily VCL using units that define controls.
    (tnoptfrm emulvt, wait and pop3cli use forms heavily. tnemulvt
         uses emulvt)

As said category 1 and 2 only need the "general" fixes, and a few "per unit"
 fixes.

Category 3 also, but needs some work done to hack up a dummy forms unit,
        will also need to fix.

Category 4 Maybe (partially?) portable to lazarus in a year time, but I
         don't touch them for now.

[general changes]
- icsdef.inc included everywhere, the right spot is after the
        interface keyword
- When "usewindows" is defined, use the windows unit
  Affects nearly all "uses" clauses AND qualified unitname use.
  This looks like
    {$Ifdef usewindows}Windows, {$else}WinTypes, WinProcs, {$endif}
- introduce noforms check everywhere (controls graphics etc, except for units
        that actually define only controls (category 4)
- Some of the comments braces in the unit description (the large
        comment which is first in each unit) need to be balanced TP style,
        because only the icsdef.inc puts FPC in Delphi mode.
        (about 2 or 3 occurances)


[unit specific changes]
- [wsocket] Some minor fixes for pass by reference of a longint
            being incompatible
            when the function is defined as ulong(=longword)

- [mbxfile] had a lines 329 and 332 fixed.
         NewPos + p - Buf - 3 becomes  NewPos + (p - Buf) - 3
         This is a FPC bug, but the fix doesn't matter for Delphi,
         and makes life easier for time being.


Per file:
- tncnx, pop3prot, nntpcli and ftpsrv wants (de)allocatehwnd

- pop3prot also uses the "application" object. Some demoes do too
         (concli2)
- wsocket had some minor fixes for pass by reference of a longint being incompatible
         when the function is defined as ulong(=longword)
- mbxfile had a lines 329 and 332 fixed.
         NewPos + p - Buf - 3 becomes  NewPos + (p - Buf) - 3
- tnoptfrm emulvt, wait and pop3cli  use forms heavily. tnemulvt
         uses emulvt
