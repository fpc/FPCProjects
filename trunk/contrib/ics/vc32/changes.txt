This is a FPC work copy of ICS, with slightly rearranged directories for
easier CVSing.

All copyrights of Francois Piette are retained. The FPC contribution is
merely some compability fixes and release engineering.

Changes:

In general and wsocket unit:

- icsdef.inc included everywhere.
- When "usewindows" is defined, use the windows unit.
  Affects nearly all "uses" clauses AND qualified unitname use.
- Some minor fixes for pass by reference of a longint being incompatible
        when the function is defined as ulong(=longword)
