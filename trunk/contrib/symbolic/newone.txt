Simplifications
----------------

SimplifyConstants:

If Mode=0: only check integrity



- Evaluates all real constants, including things like Sin(5.0)
- Evaluates Real



                                  CO
                                /   \
                               /     \
                             A         B
                           /    \      /  \
                         /       \   /     \
                        C         D  E      F


Node types:

        Ci constant             (nodetype=iconstnode)
        Cr real constant,       (nodetype=constnode)
        Cy expression           (ExprIsConstant IN Flags, things like Sin(5) or even 4 DIV 6 if integer to real is off)
        Cn is any of the three above constant types
        CO= Commutative Operator (mul, add)
        X  Any other expression,



        Constants always have to be arranged Ci<Cr<Cy<

if A <> CO then (C and D have no relevance)
if B <> CO then (E and F have no relevance)

          A   C    D   B    E   F
action    Cn  -    -   CO   Cn  Cn               (killed in SimplifyConstants}
          Cn  -    -   CO   X   Cn               (Changed to E=C, F=X in killed in SimplifyConstants)
          Cn  -    -   CO   Cn   X               (if A=Cx and E=Ci then swap(A,E))
          X   -    -   CO
