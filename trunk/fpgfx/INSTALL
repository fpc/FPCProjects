1. This is not even alpha software. Don't use it for development yet.

2. Do build the library and the examples, you will need a recent version
   of the Free Pascal compiler (FPC). Check http://www.freepascal.org/ on
   how to obtain the latest release.

3. For building the HTML documentation, you will need the following packages:
   * Jade, the SGML/XML DSSSL engine
   * DocBook XML

4. To make everything just enter "make" in this directory. To build only parts
   of this package, enter the according directory and issue a "make" command
   there.
   The makefiles for subdirectories, the library and the examples use fpcmake,
   so they will understand the common FPC make rules.


Have fun,
Sebastian
